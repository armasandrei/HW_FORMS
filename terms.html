<h1  >  Terms and Conditions </h1>
<hr>
     <p> A terms and conditions agreement outlines the website administrator’s 
       rules regarding user behavior, and provides
        information about the actions the website administrator can and will perform.
    </p>
      <p> Your terms and conditions text is a contract between your website and its users. In the event of a legal dispute,
          arbitrators will look to this agreement to determine whether each party acted within their rights.
     </p>

<ul>
      <li> <b>Abusive users </b> — Terms and conditions allow you to 
          establish what constitutes appropriate activity on 
          your site or app,
          so you can remove abusive users and content that violates 
          your guidelines. 
      </li>
         <br>

      <li>
        <b> Intellectual property theft </b> — Asserting your claim to the creative 
         assets of your site in your terms and conditions will
        prevent ownership disputes and copyright infringement.
      </li>
          <br>
      <li>
        <b>Potential litigation </b> — If a user lodges a legal complaint against
         your business, showing that they were presented with
        clear terms and conditions before they used your site will help 
        you immensely in court.
      </li>


   </ul>
   <br>
<p>
    In short, terms and conditions give you control over your site and legal 
    enforcement if users try to take advantage of
    your operations.
